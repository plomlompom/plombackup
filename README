plombackup: plomlompom's backup script
======================================

Description
-----------

This script automates plomlompom's backup process. It copies files and
directories named in a text file into a directory on a LUKS-encrypted
device. It needs three arguments:

-i: the relative path of a text file that contains on each line the
    relative path of a file or directory to back up

-d: the absolute or relative path of a block device with a
    LUKS-encrypted filesystem on it

-o: the path of a directory on the aforementioned filesystem into which
    to back up the files and directories; this path must be relative to
    the root of said filesystem

On execution, the script asks for the LUKS decryption key. It may
further ask for confirmation before overwriting an existing backup
directory. Into the backup directory, it writes a file "lastupdate" that
contains the date of the backup process.

Further options:

-h: Print a short script usage info.

-c: Compare all file copies against their respective originals to warn
    against potential data corruption. Makes the whole process take A
    LOT more time.

Internals
---------

The script opens and closes the LUKS container and mounts its
filesystem to /mnt/secret (and unmounts it again when finished). If
/mnt/secret does not exist, it gets created for the duration of the
script and deleted at the end. Various safeguards are implemented to
avoid collisions with other mounts, device mappings, existing
directories etc. If foreseeable errors occur, the script tries to clean
up and exits. If unforeseen errors occur, the script does not clean up
on exit, but informs on what should be done to clean up manually.
