This script automates plomlompom's backup process. It's not very
sophisticated or well-structured, but it currently does the job. It
needs three arguments:

- the relative path of a text file that contains on each line the
  relative path of a file or directory to back up

- the absolute or relative path of a block device with a
  LUKS-encrypted filesystem on it

- the path of a directory on the aforementioned filesystem into which
  to back up the files and directories; this path must be relative to
  the root of said filesystem

On execution, the script asks for the LUKS decryption key. It may
further ask for confirmation before overwriting existing backup
directory. Into the backup directory, it writes a file "lastupdate" that
contains the date of the backup process. In the improbable case that a
file with such a name already exists (if one was selected to be backed
up by the file that lists what to back up), it also asks for
confirmation on overwriting that one. In the end, all file copies are
compared against their original to warn against potential data
corruption.

The script opens and closes the LUKS container and mounts its
filesystem to /mnt/secret (and unmounts it again when finished). If
/mnt/secret does not exists, it gets created for the duration of the
script and deleted at the end. Various safeguards are implemented to
avoid collisions with other mounts, device mappings, existing
directories etc. If foreseeable errors occur, the script tries to clean
up and exits. If unforeseen errors occur, the script does not clean up
on exit, but informs on what should be done to clean up manually.
